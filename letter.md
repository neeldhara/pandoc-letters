I have a new plan: to go mad. That's the way: for people to lose their heads, and then be cured and brought back to reason ! If you've read all Hoffmann, you'll surely remember Alban. How do you like him ? It is terrible to watch a man who has the incomprehensible within his grasp, does not know what to do with it, and sits playing with a toy called God ! 

Your devoted friend,
